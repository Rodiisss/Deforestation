                <h2>What causes deforestation?</h2>
                <p>Why is deforestation taking place? Agriculture is responsible for almost 80% of deforestation, according to the FAO. Agriculture such as commercial and industrial culture is responsible for 40% of forest loss because of the search for space to grow biofuels such as palm oil. Urbanization and the growth of cities have also pushed the natural boundaries that surround them.</p>

                <img class="deforestation-img" src="images/deforestation3.jpg" alt="deforestaion-img">
                <p>The construction of human infrastructures has also been a factor in driving deforestation. More importantly, 10% of deforestation can be attributed to new infrastructures that serve transportation, transformation, and energy generation. The need for large extraction, transportation, and transformation infrastructures for different types of products such as meat, coal, and oil have also affected deforestation.</p>

                    <p class="causes">Soil erosion also occurs because of deforestation. The soil is rich because the sun-blocking tree cover helps the soil to slowly dry out. Without the trees, the soil will become fragile and leave the area vulnerable to disasters.</p>
